## Introduction
Welcome to the RetroPie Project! RetroPie is a versatile software solution that allows you to transform your Raspberry Pi into a full-fledged retro gaming console. It takes you back to the golden days of gaming where the concept was very simple but still fun. So you can play all the classic games you want, from Tetris to Mario. It does take you back to your childhood

## Features

- The console is battery-powered
- It can be charged with USB-C
- Designing PCB so that it takes up as little space as possible


## Software
One of the essential parts of the Retropie and maybe the beating heart of the project is the emulator. This is a software that makes it possible to put older games on a recent console. They actually form a bridge between the present and the past. This allows gamers to enjoy old games without playing on an old console.
