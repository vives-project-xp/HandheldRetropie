## Introduction
Welcome to the RetroPie Project! RetroPie is a versatile software solution that allows you to transform your Raspberry Pi into a full-fledged retro gaming console. It takes you back to the golden days of gaming where the concept was very simple but still fun. So you can play all the classic games you want, from Tetris to Mario. It does take you back to your childhood.

## Features

- The console is battery-powered.
- Easy to switch batterys.
- Designing PCB so that it takes up as little space as possible.
- Custom made casing.
- Uploading new games trough wifi.
- Battery indicator.
- Active cooling with PWM fans.
- Build in speakers.


## Software
One of the essential parts of the Retropie and maybe the beating heart of the project is the emulator. This is a software that makes it possible to put older games on a recent console. They actually form a bridge between the present and the past. This allows gamers to enjoy old games without playing on an old console. There will be a program running parallel with the games that calculates a PWM signal for cooling the system. This is calculated by the temperature inside the processor. the hotter it gets, the higher the PWM duty cycle gets, and thus cooling the system more.
